    "The NMF and LDA models allows for topic extraction/modeling from a corpus. I've learned that the Topic extraction involves many parts (number of samples, features, components, etc.) and requires a strong understanding of the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and CountVectorizer. I've learned that tf-idf operates based on a value/weight of the terms in a corpus that increases proportionally to the count, but it is offset by the frequency of the term. The Count Vectorizer emphasize on counting the frequencies of a term. Both NMF models utilize stop words to remove low value terms that are not specifically related to the topic, or are \"filler words\" such as \"like\", \"the\", \"a\", \"to\", etc. The Frobenius Norm model output high value terms that are popular within the topic, for example, a topic relating to Sports will output sport-related terms such as \"game\",\"team\",\"win\",\"play\",\"season\",etc., but doesn't necessarily give us the specific topic at hand (What is this sports topic pertaining to? What is the story?)   \n",
    "\n",
    "The Kullback-Leibler divergence NMF model gives us more specifity regarding the topic compared to the Frobenius Norm NMF model. Unlike the Frobenius Norm, that outputs popular terms of the topic, the kullback-leibler provides a more accurate read of each topic that captures the main idea of the text. Topic 7, for example, the Frobenius Norm output terms that are popular in hockey ('goal','nhl','flyers'). Kullback-leibler provides a stronger explanation for topic 7 in the corpus pertaining to the overall specific \"headline\" of topic 7. LDA is a topic extraction model that clusters various terms together within a topic. Topics are composed of a \"mixture of topics\" and doesn't necessarily give us the main topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparison, the LDA model is the slowest in regards to operation and outputting data for topics. The fastest topic extraction model is the Frobenius Norm ."
